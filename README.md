# python_programming_program

This repository contains my course materials and progress in a Python/data analytics course program. The materials include code, Jupyter notebooks, data sets, and other resources. The code is organized by topic, and the notebooks contain explanations of the code and exercises for the reader to complete. The data sets are used in the exercises, and they are also available for download.

This repository is a great way for me to keep track of my progress and share my work with others. It is also a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in learning Python or data analytics.

The repository is still under development, but I plan to add more materials and exercises as I continue to learn.
